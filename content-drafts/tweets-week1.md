### Day 1 — Monday, Feb 18

**Tweet 1 (Launch announcement)**
I built a directory of AI tools that actually matter for solo builders.

No enterprise bloat. No "contact sales." Just tools you can use today to ship faster alone.

It's called AI Freedom Stack.

**Tweet 2 (Hot take)**
Martin Fowler wrote about "AI velocity becoming a debt accelerator" and he's right.

Most teams use AI to write more code faster. Solo builders use AI to write less code better.

That's the difference.

**Tweet 3 (CTA)**
If you build alone and want a curated list of AI tools that respect your time (and wallet), check out freedomstackai.com

No fluff. Updated weekly.

### Day 2 — Tuesday, Feb 19

**Tweet 1 (Tool spotlight)**
Cursor is still the best AI code editor for solo devs. Not because it's the smartest — because it stays out of your way until you need it.

Most AI coding tools want to drive. Cursor lets you steer.

**Tweet 2 (Engagement — question)**
Honest question for solo builders:

What's the ONE AI tool you'd keep if you had to delete all the others?

### Day 3 — Wednesday, Feb 20

**Tweet 1 (Thread — 6 tweets: "The Solo Builder AI Stack for 2026")**

1/ Every solo builder I know is drowning in AI tool options. Here's the stack I'd start with today if I had nothing.

2/ **Code:** Cursor or Windsurf. Pick one. Stop switching. The context window matters more than the model — feed it your whole codebase and let it work.

3/ **Writing:** Claude for long-form. ChatGPT for brainstorming. Don't use either for your landing page copy — that still needs your voice.

4/ **Images:** Midjourney for hero images. Recraft for icons and UI elements. DALL-E for quick mockups you'll throw away.

5/ **Automation:** n8n self-hosted beats Zapier for anything non-trivial. If you're paying $50/mo for Zapier you're doing it wrong.

6/ **Mail/support:** Loops for email. Intercom's AI for support if you can afford it, otherwise just use a shared inbox and Claude to draft replies.

### Day 4 — Thursday, Feb 21

**Tweet 1 (News hot take)**
Netflix threatening to sue ByteDance over Seedance generating Stranger Things clips is just the beginning.

Every AI video tool is a copyright lawsuit waiting to happen. If you're building on top of these, have a plan B.

**Tweet 2 (Workflow tip)**
Workflow of the day:

Before you write a single line of code, paste your idea into Claude and ask: "What are the 3 ways this fails?"

Saves me ~4 hours a week in wrong-direction building.

### Day 5 — Friday, Feb 22

**Tweet 1 (Tool spotlight)**
Anthropic dropped Sonnet 4.6 and it's noticeably better at computer use.

For solo builders this matters: AI that can actually navigate your spreadsheets and fill forms is closer to a real virtual assistant than a chatbot.

**Tweet 2 (Engagement — poll)**
Solo builders — where do you spend the MOST time you wish AI could handle?

🅰️ Customer support
🅱️ Marketing/content
🅲 Bookkeeping/admin
🅳 Bug fixing

**Tweet 3 (Newsletter plug)**
First issue of the AI Freedom Stack newsletter drops this week.

Weekly roundup of tools, workflows, and what's overhyped — written for people who build alone.

### Day 6 — Saturday, Feb 23

**Tweet 1 (Thread — 5 tweets: "Stop paying for AI tools you don't need")**

1/ I audited my AI subscriptions last month. I was paying $340/mo across 9 tools. I cut it to $95 and ship faster now.

2/ The trap: every new AI tool has a free tier that hooks you, then you upgrade "just for this one feature." Multiply by 10 tools and you're bleeding.

3/ What I cut: Jasper (Claude does it better for free). Copy.ai (same). Two image generators when one works fine. A "meeting summarizer" I used twice.

4/ What I kept: Cursor Pro, Claude Pro, one image tool, n8n self-hosted. That's the core. Everything else is optional.

5/ Before you subscribe to anything new, ask: "Does this replace something or add complexity?" If it adds complexity, skip it.

### Day 7 — Sunday, Feb 24

**Tweet 1 (Reflection / engagement)**
The best AI tool for solo builders isn't a tool.

It's the discipline to say "I don't need that" 9 times out of 10.

**Tweet 2 (Week ahead tease)**
This week on AI Freedom Stack:

→ Deep dive on local AI models (run it on your hardware, own your data)
→ The real cost of "free" AI APIs
→ Tool spotlight: the automation setup that replaced my VA
