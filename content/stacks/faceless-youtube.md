# The Faceless YouTube Stack

**A complete YouTube channel without showing your face or hiring anyone.** AI writes your scripts, generates your voice, creates your visuals, and you just edit and upload. Channels using this approach are pulling 10K–100K+ views per video in niches like finance, history, tech explainers, and motivation.

## Who It's For

- **Best for:** Side-hustlers, niche content creators, and anyone who wants YouTube ad revenue without being on camera.
- **Not for:** Vloggers, personality-driven creators, or anyone whose audience expects a human face. Also not ideal if you need real-world footage (travel, cooking).

## Freedom Score: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

- **Why 4:** You own your channel, your scripts, and your video files. Voice and images are generated fresh each time. Swapping any single tool is straightforward.
- **Lock-in risk:** Minimal. The only real dependency is your YouTube channel itself — but that's the distribution, not the tooling.

## Getting Started (This Weekend)

1. **Pick your niche.** Top faceless niches: personal finance, AI/tech explainers, history, psychology, "top 10" lists, motivation. Pick one you can talk about for 100 videos.
2. **Set up Claude.** Create a system prompt: "You are a YouTube scriptwriter for a [niche] channel. Scripts should be 8-12 minutes of spoken content with visual cues in brackets."
3. **Generate your first script.** Ask Claude for a script on a trending topic in your niche. Include hook, body, CTA.
4. **Record voiceover in ElevenLabs.** Paste the script, pick a voice, download the MP3.
5. **Generate visuals.** Use the visual cues from your script to prompt Stable Diffusion or Midjourney. Aim for 15-25 images per video.
6. **Assemble in CapCut or DaVinci Resolve.** Drop in narration, layer visuals on the timeline, add auto-captions, background music, transitions.
7. **Upload and optimize.** Use Claude to write your title, description, and tags.

**Expected output:** 2-3 videos/week. Each video takes 3-5 hours start to finish once you have a rhythm.
