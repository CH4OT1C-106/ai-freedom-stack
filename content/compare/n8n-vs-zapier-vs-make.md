## The Quick Answer

**n8n** for power and freedom (self-host, unlimited, free). **Zapier** for simplicity (most integrations, easiest setup). **Make** for the middle ground (powerful + affordable + no self-hosting). Your technical comfort determines the right pick.

---

## Pricing (This Is Where It Gets Real)

| | n8n | Zapier | Make |
|---|---|---|---|
| Free tier | Unlimited (self-hosted) | 100 tasks/mo | 1,000 ops/mo |
| Entry paid | $20/mo (cloud) | $20/mo | $9/mo |
| Mid tier | $50/mo | $49/mo | $16/mo |
| At scale | Still cheap | Gets painful | Moderate |

n8n self-hosted is free forever with unlimited workflows. That's the nuclear option for budget-conscious solo builders. Zapier is the most expensive at scale. Make sits in between.

## Ease of Use

**Winner: Zapier**

Zapier's interface is designed for non-technical people. If you can fill out a form, you can build a Zapier automation. The templates library means you barely need to build anything from scratch.

Make is visual and intuitive but assumes you understand data structures.

n8n is powerful but expects some technical comfort. Not hard, but not hand-holding either.

**Ranking:** Zapier (easiest) → Make (medium) → n8n (most technical)

---

## Power & Flexibility

**Winner: n8n**

n8n lets you drop into JavaScript or Python when the visual editor isn't enough. You can call any API, run custom logic, process data however you want. There's no ceiling.

Make is surprisingly powerful with its data transformation tools and routing logic. Most complex workflows are possible.

Zapier intentionally limits complexity to keep things simple. Advanced users will hit walls.

**Ranking:** n8n (most powerful) → Make (strong) → Zapier (intentionally limited)

---

## Integrations

**Winner: Zapier**

| | n8n | Zapier | Make |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native integrations | 400+ | 6,000+ | 1,500+ |
| Custom API | Yes (HTTP node) | Yes (Webhooks) | Yes (HTTP module) |

Zapier has the most integrations by far. But all three let you call any API, so native integration count matters less than it seems. If a service has an API, all three can connect to it.

---

## Self-Hosting & Data Control

**Winner: n8n (only option)**

n8n is the only one you can self-host. Your automations, your data, your server. Zapier and Make are cloud-only — your workflows and data live on their servers.

For solo builders handling sensitive data or wanting full control, this is the deciding factor.

---

## AI Workflow Support

**Tie (all three work)**

All three connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI APIs. n8n has the most flexible implementation (custom code nodes for complex AI chains). Make and Zapier have native OpenAI modules that cover common use cases.

## The Freedom Score Angle

| Factor | n8n | Zapier | Make |
|--------|-----|--------|------|
| Vendor lock-in | Low | High | High |
| Solo builder fit | Excellent | Good | Good |
| Cost efficiency | Best | Worst | Good |
| Portability | Self-host | Cloud-only | Cloud-only |
| Open source | Yes | No | No |
| **Freedom Score** | **9/10** | **4/10** | **5/10** |

## So Which One?

**Pick n8n if:**
- You can run Docker (or are willing to learn)
- Budget matters and you want unlimited free automations
- You need custom code in your workflows
- Data privacy and self-hosting matter

**Pick Zapier if:**
- You want the easiest possible setup
- You need integrations with niche tools
- You only have a few simple automations
- Technical stuff isn't your thing

**Pick Make if:**
- You want power without self-hosting
- Budget is moderate ($9-16/mo is fine)
- You build complex workflows with data transformation
- You're somewhere between technical and non-technical
