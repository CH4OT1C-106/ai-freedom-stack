## Obsidian vs Notion vs Logseq: The Quick Answer

**Obsidian** is the freedom play — local files, your data, plugin ecosystem. **Notion** is the all-in-one workspace — databases, wikis, projects. **Logseq** is the outliner for networked thinkers — open source, graph-first, block-based. For solo builders who care about owning their notes: Obsidian. For project management + notes in one place: Notion. For daily journaling and idea linking: Logseq.

## Data Ownership

**Winner: Obsidian**

Obsidian stores everything as plain Markdown files on your computer. Your notes are yours — open them in any text editor, back them up however you want, sync with Git, Dropbox, or Syncthing. If Obsidian disappears tomorrow, you have a folder of .md files. You lose nothing.

Logseq also stores local Markdown/org-mode files. Same principle — your data stays on your machine.

Notion stores everything in their cloud. Export is possible (as Markdown or CSV), but it's lossy — complex databases, linked views, and embeds don't survive the export cleanly. If Notion shuts down or changes pricing, migration is painful.

## Organization Model

**Different philosophies**

**Obsidian:** Files and folders, with wiki-style links between notes. Organize however you want — hierarchical folders, flat with tags, or pure links. Maximum flexibility.

**Notion:** Pages and databases. Everything is a page that can contain anything — text, tables, kanban boards, galleries. Powerful but opinionated. You build structure with databases and views.

**Logseq:** Blocks and outlines. Everything is a bullet point that can be linked, referenced, and queried. Daily journal pages are the entry point. Less structured, more organic.

For solo builders: Obsidian if you think in documents. Notion if you think in databases. Logseq if you think in fragments.

## Project Management

**Winner: Notion**

Notion's databases are genuinely excellent for project management. Kanban boards, tables with filters, timelines, calendars — all views of the same data. For a solo builder tracking tasks, clients, and content, Notion can replace Trello, Airtable, and a wiki simultaneously.

Obsidian can do basic task management with plugins (Kanban, Tasks, Dataview), but it's duct-taped together compared to Notion's native databases.

Logseq has TODO management built into its block system, which works for personal task tracking but can't match Notion's structured views.

## Knowledge Graph

**Winner: Logseq / Obsidian (tie)**

Both Obsidian and Logseq show you how your notes connect via a graph view. Over time, you build a web of linked ideas that surfaces connections you wouldn't have noticed otherwise.

Notion has no graph view. Links exist but there's no visualization of how your knowledge connects. For anyone who values thinking tools over productivity tools, this matters.

---

## Collaboration

**Winner: Notion (by a mile)**

Notion is built for teams. Real-time collaboration, comments, permissions, shared workspaces — it all works. If you ever work with someone else, Notion makes sharing effortless.

Obsidian is single-player. Obsidian Publish lets you share vaults as websites, but real-time collaboration doesn't exist.

Logseq is also primarily single-player, though it has some early collaboration features.

For solo builders: collaboration might not matter today, but if you hire a VA or take on a partner, Notion's sharing is ready.

---

## Plugins & Extensibility

**Winner: Obsidian**

Obsidian's plugin ecosystem is enormous — 1,500+ community plugins. Calendar views, Kanban boards, Dataview queries, Templater automation, citation managers, AI integrations — if you can imagine it, someone built a plugin. You can make Obsidian do almost anything.

Logseq has a growing plugin ecosystem but much smaller.

Notion has integrations but no true plugin system. You get what Notion builds.

## Pricing

| | Obsidian | Notion | Logseq |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core app | Free | Free (personal) | Free |
| Sync | $4/mo (Obsidian Sync) | Included | Free (manual/Git) |
| Publish | $8/mo | Free (basic sharing) | N/A |
| AI features | Plugins (bring your key) | $10/mo add-on | Plugins |

Obsidian is free to use. You only pay for optional sync and publish services. Logseq is completely free and open source. Notion is free for personal use but charges for AI and team features.

## The Freedom Score Angle

| Factor | Obsidian | Notion | Logseq |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Vendor lock-in | None | High | None |
| Solo builder fit | Excellent | Excellent | Good |
| Cost efficiency | Excellent | Good | Best |
| Portability | Full (Markdown) | Poor | Full (Markdown) |
| Open source | No (free, not OSS) | No | Yes |
| **Freedom Score** | **9/10** | **4/10** | **10/10** |

Logseq gets a perfect score — open source, local-first, Markdown files. Obsidian is close but isn't open source (the app is free, the code isn't). Notion is the lock-in risk.

## So Which One?

**Pick Obsidian if:**
- You want to own your notes forever as plain files
- You love customizing tools with plugins
- You think in long-form documents and linked ideas
- Privacy and portability are non-negotiable

**Pick Notion if:**
- You need project management and notes in one place
- You might collaborate with others
- You want powerful databases without code
- You're okay with cloud-only storage

**Pick Logseq if:**
- You want the most open, free option
- You think in outlines and daily journals
- Graph-based knowledge linking excites you
- You're comfortable with a slightly rougher UX

**The honest take:** Most solo builders should start with Obsidian. It's the best balance of power, freedom, and usability. Notion is the right call if project management is as important as note-taking. Logseq is for the philosophically committed.
