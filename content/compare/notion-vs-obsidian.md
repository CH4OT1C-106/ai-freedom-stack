## The Quick Answer

**Notion** for collaboration and all-in-one workspace. **Obsidian** for data ownership and privacy. Solo builders who work alone should default to Obsidian. The files are yours forever.

---

## Data Ownership

**Winner: Obsidian (this is the whole game)**

Obsidian stores everything as plain `.md` files in a folder on your machine. You can open them in any text editor. If Obsidian disappeared tomorrow, your notes are fine.

Notion stores everything in their proprietary cloud database. Export is possible but lossy — you'll lose formatting, databases, and relations. If Notion disappears or changes pricing, your knowledge base is at risk.

For solo builders building a long-term knowledge base, this is the deciding factor.

## Features

**Winner: Notion (as a product)**

Notion is genuinely impressive as a product. Databases, kanban boards, calendars, team wikis, public pages — it does everything in one app with a beautiful UI.

Obsidian does notes with linking. Everything else comes from plugins. The plugin ecosystem is massive (1000+), but it's assemble-your-own compared to Notion's integrated experience.

---

## AI Features

**Winner: Notion (built-in) / Obsidian (more flexible)**

Notion AI ($10/mo add-on) is baked into the app — summarize, draft, brainstorm inline. It's convenient but mediocre compared to Claude or ChatGPT.

Obsidian has AI plugins (Smart Connections, Copilot) that connect to local LLMs or cloud APIs. More powerful and flexible, but requires setup.

Honest take: Both AI integrations are worse than just using Claude directly. Don't pick either tool for its AI features.

## Pricing

**Winner: Obsidian**

| | Obsidian | Notion |
|---|---|---|
| Personal use | Free | Free (limited) |
| Full features | Free | $10/mo |
| AI add-on | Free (plugins) | $10/mo |
| Sync | $4/mo (or DIY free) | Included |
| Total for solo use | $0-4/mo | $10-20/mo |

---

## Offline Access

**Winner: Obsidian**

Obsidian works fully offline — it's just files on your disk. Notion requires internet for most operations. There's an offline mode but it's limited and unreliable.

## The Freedom Score Angle

| Factor | Obsidian | Notion |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Vendor lock-in | None | High |
| Solo builder fit | Excellent | Good |
| Cost efficiency | Best | Moderate |
| Portability | Plain markdown | Proprietary |
| Open source | No (but open format) | No |
| **Freedom Score** | **9/10** | **4/10** |

## So Which One?

**Pick Obsidian if:**
- You work alone (most solo builders)
- Data ownership matters to you
- You want free or very cheap
- You're comfortable with a plugin ecosystem
- You value offline access

**Pick Notion if:**
- You collaborate with others regularly
- You want databases, kanban, and calendars in one tool
- You prefer polished out-of-the-box experience
- You're okay with cloud dependency

**The freedom-first answer:** Obsidian. Your notes are the foundation of your knowledge and business. Own them.
