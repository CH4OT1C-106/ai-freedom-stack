## What This Is

AI Freedom Stack is a curated directory of AI tools reviewed specifically for **solo builders** — freelancers, indie makers, one-person startups, and anyone using AI to build something of their own.

Every review answers one question: **Does this tool help you build independently, or does it create another dependency?**

## Why This Exists

Most AI tool directories are built for enterprise buyers. They rank by features nobody uses, ignore pricing gotchas, and treat every tool like it deserves 4.5 stars.

We review tools the way a solo builder actually evaluates them:

- **What does it cost when you're bootstrapping?**
- **Does the free tier actually work, or is it bait?**
- **Can you leave if something better comes along?**
- **Does it help one person do the work of ten?**

## The Freedom Score

Every tool gets a **Freedom Score (1-10)** — our proprietary rating that measures how well a tool serves someone building independently.

It's weighted across five factors:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Vendor Lock-in | 25% | Can you leave? Export your data? Switch without starting over? |
| Solo Builder Fit | 25% | Is this useful for one person, or does it need a team? |
| Cost Efficiency | 20% | Price relative to value when you're bootstrapping |
| Portability | 15% | Cross-platform? Self-hostable? Plays nice with other tools? |
| Open Source | 15% | Code open? Pricing transparent? Can you inspect it? |

**🟢 9-10 — Freedom First.** Open source, self-hostable, no lock-in.  
**🟢 7-8 — Builder Friendly.** Great for solo use, fair pricing, low friction.  
**🟡 5-6 — Proceed with Caution.** Useful but watch the strings.  
**🟠 3-4 — Leash Detected.** Use it, but have an exit plan.  
**🔴 1-2 — Trap Tool.** Built to capture, not to serve.  

Nobody else rates AI tools from this angle. That's the point.

## Who's Behind This

I'm **Adrian** — I build with AI tools every day and got tired of reviews that don't say anything useful. No corporate team. No sponsored rankings. No "we partnered with..." disclaimers hiding bias.

Tools that earn affiliate commissions are marked. The review doesn't change based on whether there's a commission — plenty of tools on this site have no affiliate program and still get recommended. Plenty of tools with affiliate programs get honest criticism.
