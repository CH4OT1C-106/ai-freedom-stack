Welcome to the first weekly roundup from AI Freedom Stack.

Every week, we cut through the noise and surface the AI tools and updates that actually matter if you're building solo. No hype. No "top 100 AI tools" listicles. Just what's useful, what's not, and what you should pay attention to.

## 🔥 The Headline: Kimi K2.5's Agent Swarm

A Beijing-based company called Moonshot AI quietly released a model called Kimi K2.5, and its standout feature — Agent Swarm — is genuinely unlike anything else available right now.

Instead of processing complex research tasks linearly, K2.5 breaks them into parallel sub-tasks handled by specialized agents. For solo builders doing market research, competitive analysis, or content research, this is a real game-changer.

## 🛠️ Tools That Dropped

**Cursor 1.0** — The AI code editor hit a major milestone. Tab completion is faster, context window is larger, and the free tier is more generous. If you're building anything with code, this is the one.

**ElevenLabs v3 voices** — New voice models with better pacing and more natural pauses. We've been testing them for YouTube content and the improvement is noticeable.

## 💡 Workflow of the Week

**The 30-Minute Video Pipeline:**
1. Write a script with Claude (15 min with revisions)
2. Generate voiceover with ElevenLabs (2 min)
3. Tighten pauses with ffmpeg (automated, 30 sec)
4. Generate visuals with Gemini 3 Pro (5 min)
5. Assemble in Kdenlive (20 min timing pass)

Total: One finished YouTube video in under an hour of active work. We used this exact pipeline for our first video this week.

## 🔮 One Thing to Watch

Google just opened up Imagen 4.0 through their free API tier. Image generation quality is catching up to Midjourney, and it's completely free. We'll have a full review next week.
