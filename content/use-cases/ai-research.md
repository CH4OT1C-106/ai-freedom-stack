# Tools for AI-Powered Research

Use AI to research faster, synthesize information from multiple sources, and produce well-sourced analysis.

---

### Deep Research & Synthesis

- **[Claude](/tools/claude/)** — Best for long-form analysis and synthesis. 200K token context window lets you feed entire documents and get comprehensive summaries. Projects feature stores research context across conversations.
- **[Kimi K2.5](/tools/kimi-k25/)** — Massive context window for processing large documents. Strong at multi-source synthesis.
- **Perplexity AI** — AI search engine that cites its sources. Good for initial research and fact-finding. Free tier is useful; Pro unlocks more powerful models.

### Document Processing

- **Whisper (local)** — Transcribe interviews, podcasts, lectures, and meetings. Run locally for free with [Ollama](/tools/ollama/).
- **NotebookLM (Google)** — Upload documents and chat with them. Auto-generates summaries, FAQs, and audio overviews.

### Knowledge Management

- **Obsidian** — Local-first note-taking with bidirectional linking. Build a personal knowledge graph from your research. Pairs beautifully with [Ollama](/tools/ollama/) for local AI chat about your notes.
- **Logseq** — Open-source alternative to Obsidian. Outline-based. Good for daily journals and block-level references.

### Data Analysis

- **[Claude](/tools/claude/)** — Upload CSVs and get analysis, charts, and insights. Artifacts feature renders visualizations inline.
- **Julius AI** — Purpose-built for data analysis. Upload spreadsheets, ask questions in plain English, get charts and statistical analysis.

### Citation & Writing

- **Zotero** — Free, open-source reference manager. Essential for academic or well-sourced writing.
- **[Claude](/tools/claude/)** — Draft research reports, literature reviews, and analysis from your collected sources.

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Discover** — Use Perplexity to survey a topic and collect initial sources
2. **Collect** — Save sources to Zotero, transcribe audio with Whisper
3. **Process** — Feed documents to Claude or Kimi for synthesis and analysis
4. **Connect** — Store insights in Obsidian, link related concepts
5. **Produce** — Draft final output with Claude, citing your sources
