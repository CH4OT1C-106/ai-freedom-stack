### Scriptwriting

- **[Claude](/tools/claude/)** — Best overall for long-form YouTube scripts. Handles research, outlines, and full 10-minute scripts with visual cues. Excellent at matching a channel's voice with system prompts.
- **[Kimi K2.5](/tools/kimi-k25/)** — Strong alternative with large context window. Good for research-heavy scripts that need lots of source material.

### Voiceover

- **[ElevenLabs](/tools/elevenlabs/)** — The gold standard for AI voiceover. Natural-sounding narration, voice cloning, and multiple languages. Most faceless channels use this.

### Visual Generation

- **Midjourney** — Highest quality AI images for thumbnails and video visuals. Discord-based workflow.
- **Stable Diffusion (local via ComfyUI)** — Free, uncensored, unlimited. Requires a GPU but saves $10+/mo over Midjourney.

### Video Editing

- **CapCut** — Free, auto-captions, easy timeline editing. Most faceless creators start here.
- **DaVinci Resolve** — Professional-grade, free tier is incredibly powerful. Steeper learning curve but more control.

### Thumbnail Generation

- **Midjourney** — Eye-catching thumbnails with text overlay added in Canva or Photoshop.
- **Stable Diffusion** — Same quality potential, free, more control over iterations.

### Full Workflow Automation
