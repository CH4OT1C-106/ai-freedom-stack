## What is Gemini?

Google's AI platform, powered by the Gemini model family. The killer feature is context — 1M+ tokens means you can feed it entire books, codebases, or research papers. Comes with built-in Google Search, image generation (Imagen), and tight integration with Google Workspace.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Researchers, content creators processing large documents, anyone in Google's ecosystem
- **Not for:** People who need the best writing quality (Claude) or the most versatile tool (ChatGPT)
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | Gemini Pro, image gen, web search, generous limits |
| Advanced | $20/mo | 1M+ context, Workspace integration, Gemini Ultra |
| API | Pay-per-token | Pro: free tier available, Ultra from ~$1.25/M input |

**Hidden costs:** The $20/mo bundles with Google One (2TB storage), which is actually decent value if you need cloud storage anyway.

**Free tier reality check:** The best free AI tier available. Period. You can do serious work without paying.

## How we'd actually use it

Researching a new tool for your directory:

1. Feed Gemini the tool's entire documentation (huge context window handles it)
2. Add 10-15 user reviews from Reddit and forums
3. Ask it to synthesize: strengths, weaknesses, pricing gotchas, and who it's really for
4. Use Imagen to generate a comparison graphic
5. Ask it to draft the listing in your template format

**Time saved vs doing it manually:** 6 hours of research → 1 hour

## What's good

- Largest context window — nothing else comes close for processing large documents
- Free tier is genuinely the best in the industry
- Image generation (Imagen) is high quality and included free
- Google Search integration means answers are current
- API free tier lets you experiment without spending

## What's not

- Writing quality is competent but generic — lacks Claude's nuance
- Coding assistance is behind Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT
- Deep Google ecosystem integration is a double-edged sword (lock-in)
- Occasionally gives overly cautious, hedged answers
- Google's track record of killing products is a legitimate concern

## vs. the alternatives

| Feature | Gemini | Claude | ChatGPT |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Context window | 1M+ (best) | 200K | 128K |
| Free tier | Best | Limited | Good |
| Writing | Good | Best | Good |
| Image gen | Yes (Imagen) | No | Yes (DALL-E) |
| Web search | Yes (Google) | No | Yes (Bing) |
| Ecosystem | Google | Standalone | Microsoft |

**Bottom line:** Gemini for large document processing and the best free experience. Claude for quality. ChatGPT for versatility.

## FAQ

**Q: Is Gemini Advanced worth $20/mo when the free tier is so good?**
A: Only if you regularly need the 1M+ context window or Workspace integration. The free tier covers most solo builder needs.

**Q: Can I trust Google not to kill Gemini?**
A: It's their answer to ChatGPT — they're all-in. But diversify your workflows anyway. Don't build critical processes that only work with Gemini.

**Q: Gemini vs ChatGPT for a first AI tool?**
A: If budget matters, Gemini free is better than ChatGPT free. If you're paying $20/mo, it's a toss-up based on whether you value context size (Gemini) or features (ChatGPT).
