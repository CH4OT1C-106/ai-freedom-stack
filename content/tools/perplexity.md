## What is Perplexity?

A search engine that uses AI to synthesize real answers from the web, with citations. Ask it anything and it gives you a sourced summary instead of making you click through links. Pro tier adds access to Claude, GPT-4, and deeper analysis.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Researchers, content creators, anyone who googles things more than 5 times a day
- **Not for:** People who need creative writing, coding help, or image generation (use Claude/Cursor for those)
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | Unlimited quick searches, 5 Pro searches/day |
| Pro | $20/mo | 600+ Pro searches/day, model choice, file uploads |

**Hidden costs:** None, really. One of the more transparent pricing models.

**Free tier reality check:** The free tier is genuinely great. 5 Pro searches/day is enough for casual research. You'll know when you need to upgrade.

## How we'd actually use it

Researching a tool for your AI directory:

1. "What are the pros and cons of [tool] for solo developers?"
2. "What's the pricing for [tool] in 2026? Include any hidden costs"
3. "Compare [tool] vs [alternative] for indie makers"
4. Follow-up thread to go deeper on specific points
5. Export the research with citations into your draft

**Time saved vs doing it manually:** 45 minutes of tab-hopping → 10 minutes

## What's good

- Answers are sourced with citations — verify anything instantly
- Pro search digs deep, follows up, and synthesizes across multiple sources
- Thread-based — build on previous questions like a conversation
- Model switching on Pro (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- Collections let you organize research by project

## What's not

- Not a replacement for creative AI work (writing, coding, image gen)
- Sometimes over-relies on SEO-optimized content that isn't the best source
- Pro search can be slow compared to quick search
- Mobile app is good but desktop experience is better

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need Perplexity if I already have ChatGPT?**
A: Yes. ChatGPT's browsing is an add-on. Perplexity was built for search from the ground up. The citations alone make it worth it for any research-heavy work.

**Q: Can Perplexity replace Google?**
A: For research and questions, yes. For navigational searches ("take me to gmail"), just use Google. Different tools for different jobs.

**Q: Is Pro worth it?**
A: If you research tools, trends, or competitors regularly, absolutely. The 5 free Pro searches/day is enough to decide.
