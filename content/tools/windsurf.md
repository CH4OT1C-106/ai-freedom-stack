## What is Windsurf?

An AI-native code editor built by Codeium. Like Cursor, it's a standalone editor with deep AI integration — codebase-aware chat, multi-file editing, and AI-guided "flows" that help you think through problems. The main pitch: similar power to Cursor, more accessible pricing.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Solo developers who want AI coding assistance but find Cursor too expensive
- **Not for:** People already happy with Cursor (switching cost isn't worth the savings)
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | AI completions, limited premium features |
| Pro | $15/mo | Full AI features, priority models |

**Hidden costs:** None significant.

**Free tier reality check:** More generous than Cursor's free tier. Actually usable for real projects.

## How we'd actually use it

Same workflow as Cursor — describe features in natural language, let the AI write code, review and iterate. The "Cascade" feature chains multiple AI actions together for complex changes across files.

**Time saved:** Similar to Cursor — hours of coding → minutes of guiding

## What's good

- Full codebase awareness (like Cursor)
- More generous free tier than Cursor
- Cascade flows for multi-step coding tasks
- $5/mo cheaper than Cursor Pro
- Fast autocomplete from Codeium's own models

## What's not

- Newer product — less polish and fewer community resources than Cursor
- AI quality slightly behind Cursor's implementation
- Smaller user base means fewer shared tips and workflows
- Still proprietary and cloud-dependent

## vs. the alternatives

| Feature | Windsurf | Cursor | Copilot |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| Price | $15/mo | $20/mo | $10/mo |
| Codebase awareness | Yes | Yes | Limited |
| Multi-file editing | Yes | Yes | No |
| Free tier | Generous | Limited | Limited |
| Community/ecosystem | Growing | Large | Largest |

**Bottom line:** Try Windsurf's free tier. If it clicks, you save $5/mo over Cursor. If Cursor's edge matters to you, it's worth the premium.
