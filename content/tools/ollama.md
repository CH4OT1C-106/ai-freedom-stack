## What is Ollama?

Ollama is a tool that lets you download and run open-source AI models directly on your computer. No cloud, no API keys, no monthly bills. One command to install, one command to run a model. It's AI on your terms.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Privacy-conscious builders, anyone tired of API costs, developers who want local AI for testing and automation
- **Not for:** People without a computer with at least 8GB RAM (16GB+ recommended)
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Everything | $0 | Full access, all models, forever |

**Hidden costs:** Your electricity bill and hardware. Running large models needs a decent GPU or lots of RAM.

**Free tier reality check:** It's all free. The entire thing.

## How we'd actually use it

1. Install Ollama (one command)
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3`
3. Run it: `ollama run llama3`
4. Use it for drafting, brainstorming, code review — anything you'd burn API tokens on

**Time saved vs doing it manually:** N/A — it saves money, not time. Hundreds of dollars per month in API costs eliminated.

## What's good

- Completely free, forever
- Your data never leaves your machine
- Supports dozens of models (Llama, Mistral, Gemma, etc.)
- Dead simple to set up
- API-compatible — drop it into existing tools

## What's not

- Quality depends on your hardware — small machines = smaller models
- Not as powerful as frontier cloud models (GPT-5, Claude Opus)
- No built-in UI — you need a separate chat interface or use the terminal
- Model downloads are large (4-40GB each)

## FAQ

**Q: Can Ollama replace ChatGPT?**
A: For many tasks, yes. For cutting-edge reasoning or very long context, cloud models still have the edge.

**Q: What computer do I need for Ollama?**
A: Minimum 8GB RAM for small models. 16GB+ for good models. A GPU with 8GB+ VRAM makes everything much faster.

**Q: What's the best alternative to Ollama?**
A: LM Studio offers a nicer UI. LocalAI is more Docker-focused. But Ollama has the best balance of simplicity and power.
