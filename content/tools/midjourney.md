## What is Midjourney?

An AI image generation tool accessed primarily through Discord. You type prompts, it generates images. The output quality — especially for stylized, artistic, and photorealistic content — is consistently the best available. V6 is the current model.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Content creators, YouTubers, marketers who need high-quality visuals regularly
- **Not for:** Developers who occasionally need a quick image (use Gemini free), people who hate Discord
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Basic | $10/mo | ~200 images/mo |
| Standard | $30/mo | 15hr fast gen, unlimited relaxed |
| Pro | $60/mo | 30hr fast, stealth mode |

**Hidden costs:** No free tier at all. And "relaxed" mode can be painfully slow during peak hours.

**Free tier reality check:** There isn't one. You're paying from day one.

## How we'd actually use it

Creating visuals for a YouTube thumbnail and tool review:

1. `/imagine futuristic AI dashboard, dark theme, neon blue accents, clean UI --ar 16:9 --v 6`
2. Pick the best of 4 variations, upscale it
3. `/imagine [tool logo] reimagined as a 3d icon, floating, soft lighting --v 6`
4. Batch generate 5-6 variations for A/B testing thumbnails
5. Download and drop into your editor

**Time saved vs doing it manually:** Hours with a designer or stock photos → 15 minutes

## What's good

- Image quality is simply the best — nothing else matches the aesthetic consistency
- V6 handles text in images (finally)
- Style control is excellent once you learn the prompt language
- Community prompts and styles give you a massive head start

## What's not

- Discord-only workflow is clunky (web app in beta)
- No free tier — $10/mo minimum to even try it
- Learning curve on prompting is real
- Commercial rights only on paid plans
- No API — can't automate into your pipeline easily
- Proprietary and cloud-only — total vendor lock-in

## vs. the alternatives

| Feature | Midjourney | Stable Diffusion | DALL-E | Imagen (Gemini) |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Quality | Best | Good (tunable) | Good | Good |
| Price | $10-60/mo | Free (local) | In ChatGPT | Free in Gemini |
| Local/self-host | No | Yes | No | No |
| API available | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Ease of use | Medium | Hard | Easy | Easy |

**Bottom line:** Midjourney for quality. Stable Diffusion for freedom. Gemini Imagen for free and easy.

## FAQ

A: Yes, on all paid plans. Read the ToS for specifics on company size limitations.

**Q: Is the web app ready yet?**
A: It's in beta. Still missing features. Discord is the full experience for now.
