## What is HeyGen?

An AI platform that generates talking-head videos from text scripts. Pick a stock avatar (or create a clone of yourself), paste your script, and it produces a video of the avatar speaking with lip sync. Includes translation features for multilingual content.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Course creators, SaaS companies needing product demos, anyone doing multilingual video content
- **Not for:** Solo YouTube creators (audiences prefer authentic presence over AI avatars)
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | 1 video, watermarked |
| Creator | $24/mo | 15 min video/mo |
| Business | $60/mo | 60 min/mo, custom avatars |

**Hidden costs:** Minutes run out fast. A 5-minute product demo uses a third of your Creator plan. Custom avatar creation costs extra.

**Free tier reality check:** One watermarked video is barely a trial. Hard to evaluate properly.

## How we'd actually use it

Creating a product demo without being on camera:

1. Write a script for your tool walkthrough
2. Pick an avatar that matches your brand
3. Upload screen recordings as B-roll
4. HeyGen generates the talking-head segments
5. Edit together in your video editor

**Honest take:** For most solo builders, recording yourself on a phone + ElevenLabs for voiceover is cheaper and more authentic. HeyGen makes sense at scale.

## What's good

- No camera or video skills needed
- Multilingual translation is the killer feature
- Good for batch-producing training/demo videos
- Script-to-video workflow is genuinely fast
- Custom avatar clones are getting better

## What's not

- Avatars still look artificial — uncanny valley is real
- Expensive per minute of content
- Audiences are increasingly skeptical of AI avatars
- Lock-in: your avatar videos only work within HeyGen
- Custom clones have inconsistent quality

## FAQ

**Q: Should I use HeyGen for my YouTube channel?**
A: Probably not. YouTube audiences value authenticity. An AI avatar hosting your channel will hurt more than help. Use it for product demos and course content instead.

**Q: HeyGen or Synthesia?**
A: Similar products. HeyGen has better avatar quality. Synthesia has more enterprise features. For solo builders, neither is essential.
