## What is Notion AI?

An AI layer built into Notion's workspace app. It can draft content, summarize pages, brainstorm ideas, extract action items, and answer questions about your workspace. It works inline — highlight text, ask AI to improve it, done.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Existing heavy Notion users who want AI without leaving their workspace
- **Not for:** Anyone not already using Notion — don't adopt Notion just for the AI
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free + AI | Can't | AI requires paid plan |
| Plus + AI | $18/mo total | Notion workspace + unlimited AI |
| Business + AI | $25/mo total | Team features + AI |

**Hidden costs:** You're paying for Notion AND the AI. If you're not getting value from Notion itself, this is expensive for what the AI adds.

**Free tier reality check:** There isn't one for AI. You need a paid Notion plan.

## How we'd actually use it

Managing your content calendar:

1. Keep a database of tool reviews in Notion
2. For each new tool, ask AI to "draft a summary based on these notes"
3. Use AI to generate social media posts from the review
4. Summarize your weekly progress across projects
5. Extract action items from meeting notes

**Time saved:** Moderate. Maybe 15-20 minutes per content piece for drafting.

## What's good

- Lives where your notes already are — no context switching
- Inline editing is smooth (highlight → improve → done)
- Q&A over your workspace is genuinely useful
- Summarization of long pages works well

## What's not

- $10/mo add-on for what Claude/ChatGPT do better
- Can't access external data — only knows what's in your Notion
- Writing quality is mediocre compared to Claude
- Notion itself has vendor lock-in issues (export is clunky)
- Not open source, not self-hostable

## vs. the alternatives

| Feature | Notion AI | Claude | Obsidian + LLM |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Price | $10/mo add-on | $20/mo | Free |
| Writing quality | Decent | Best | Depends on model |
| Works offline | No | No | Yes |
| Data ownership | Notion's cloud | Session-based | Your files |
| Flexibility | Notion only | Any text | Any text |

**Bottom line:** If you live in Notion, it's a nice convenience. If you don't, skip it. Claude + Obsidian is the freedom-first alternative.

## FAQ

**Q: Is Notion AI worth it?**
A: Only if you're already a heavy Notion user AND you find yourself constantly switching to ChatGPT/Claude for writing tasks. The convenience tax is steep.

**Q: Can Notion AI replace ChatGPT?**
A: No. It's a narrow tool that works within Notion's walls. ChatGPT/Claude are general-purpose and far more capable.
