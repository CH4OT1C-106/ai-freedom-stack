## What is Bolt.new?

Bolt.new lets you describe a web application in plain English and builds it for you in the browser — frontend, backend, database, and deployment included. No terminal. No setup. You describe, it builds, you ship.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Non-technical entrepreneurs who need MVPs, landing pages, or internal tools fast
- **Not for:** Complex applications that need custom infrastructure or specific performance requirements
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | Limited generations per day |
| Pro | $20/mo | Unlimited generations, deployment |

**Free tier reality check:** Enough to test it. You'll need Pro to build anything real.

## How we'd actually use it

Imagine you want to build a simple SaaS tool — a client intake form that saves to a database and sends you an email:

1. Tell Bolt: "Build a client intake form with name, email, project description. Save submissions to a database and email me when someone submits."
2. Watch it build the full app in real time
3. Click deploy
4. Share the URL with clients

**Time saved vs doing it manually:** Days of development → 20 minutes

## What's good

- Literally zero setup — everything happens in the browser
- Deploys are one-click
- Great for rapid prototyping and MVPs
- Can iterate by describing changes in natural language

## What's not

- Generated code can be messy under the hood
- Limited control over architecture decisions
- Debugging is harder when you didn't write the code
- Complex apps hit limitations fast

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Bolt.new to build a real business?**
A: For simple tools and MVPs, yes. For complex SaaS products, you'll eventually need to move to a proper codebase.

**Q: Is Bolt.new better than Cursor?**
A: Different tools. Bolt is for people who don't code and want a finished app. Cursor is for people who code and want to go faster.

**Q: What's the best alternative to Bolt.new?**
A: Lovable and Replit are the closest competitors. Lovable has better UI design output, Replit has more flexibility.
