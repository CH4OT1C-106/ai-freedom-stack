## What is Synthesia?

An AI video platform focused on professional avatar-based content. Write a script, pick an avatar (150+), choose a language (120+), and generate a polished talking-head video. Aimed at enterprise training, onboarding, and marketing videos.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Companies creating training/onboarding videos, multilingual content producers
- **Not for:** Solo YouTubers, creative content makers, anyone on a tight budget
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (2/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | 1 demo video |
| Starter | $22/mo | 10 min/mo |
| Creator | $67/mo | 30 min/mo, custom avatars |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited, API access |

**Hidden costs:** Per-minute pricing punishes iteration. Every draft burns credits.

**Free tier reality check:** One video tells you nothing about ongoing value.

## What's good

- Most polished avatar quality in the market
- 120+ languages with lip sync
- Templates speed up production for repetitive content
- Enterprise integrations (LMS platforms, etc.)

## What's not

- Way too expensive for solo builders
- Still clearly AI — uncanny valley persists
- Creative flexibility is limited
- Lock-in: content lives on their platform
- Not suitable for audience-facing content on YouTube

## FAQ

**Q: Synthesia or HeyGen?**
A: HeyGen for indie/solo use (slightly cheaper). Synthesia for enterprise features. Neither is essential for most solo builders.

**Q: Can I use Synthesia for YouTube?**
A: You can, but you shouldn't. Audiences respond better to authentic presence. AI avatars hurt channel growth.
