## What is v0?

Vercel's AI-powered UI generation tool. Describe a UI component in plain English — "a pricing page with three tiers, dark theme, toggle for monthly/annual" — and it generates clean React/Next.js code using shadcn/ui components. You can iterate with follow-up prompts and export the code.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Solo builders shipping React/Next.js apps who want UI done fast
- **Not for:** People not using React, or anyone who needs backend logic (this is frontend only)
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | Limited generations per month |
| Premium | $20/mo | More generations, priority |

**Hidden costs:** Code is React/Next.js specific — you're implicitly committing to that stack.

**Free tier reality check:** Enough to prototype a few pages. Not enough for continuous use.

## How we'd actually use it

Building a landing page for your SaaS:

1. "Create a landing page with hero section, feature grid, pricing table, and FAQ accordion. Dark theme."
2. v0 generates the full page with components
3. "Make the pricing table highlight the middle tier. Add a testimonials section."
4. Export to your Next.js project
5. Customize colors and copy in Cursor

**Time saved:** A full landing page: 6-8 hours → 1 hour

## What's good

- Output quality is impressive — production-ready, not prototype-quality
- Uses shadcn/ui — real components, not throwaway code
- Iterative refinement with follow-up prompts
- Code is clean and well-structured
- Great for non-designers who need decent UI

## What's not

- Locked to React/Next.js ecosystem
- Free tier limits hit fast
- Can't handle complex interactive logic (state management, API calls)
- Sometimes generates overly complex component structures
- Vercel ecosystem lock-in (subtle but real)

## FAQ

**Q: v0 or Bolt.new?**
A: v0 for UI components you'll integrate into an existing project. Bolt for full-stack prototypes from scratch. Different tools for different stages.

**Q: Can I use v0 output outside of Next.js?**
A: The React components work in any React project. The shadcn/ui dependency is the main coupling. Non-React frameworks? Look elsewhere.

**Q: Does v0 replace a designer?**
A: For solo builders, mostly yes. The output is clean enough to ship. For polished brand-level design, you'll still want a human eye.
