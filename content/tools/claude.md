## What is Claude?

Claude is Anthropic's family of AI models. Opus is the powerhouse for deep reasoning, Sonnet is the daily driver balancing speed and quality, and Haiku is the fast/cheap option for simple tasks. For solo builders, you'll live in Sonnet 90% of the time and pull out Opus when you need to think hard.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Solo builders who need high-quality writing, complex coding help, or deep analysis
- **Not for:** People who just need quick factual lookups (Perplexity is better) or image generation
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | Limited Sonnet messages, basic features |
| Pro | $20/mo | More Sonnet, some Opus, Projects, longer context |
| API | Pay-per-token | Sonnet ~$3/M input, Opus ~$15/M input |

**Hidden costs:** Pro usage caps aren't published — you'll hit them during heavy work sessions. API is more predictable but requires technical setup.

**Free tier reality check:** Enough to evaluate. Not enough to build with daily.

## How we'd actually use it

Here's a real workflow for writing a tool review for your site:

1. Feed Claude the tool's docs, pricing page, and a few user reviews
2. Ask it to write a draft following your content template
3. Have it critique its own draft for weak spots
4. Refine with specific feedback ("make the pricing section more honest about gotchas")
5. Final pass for your voice and tone

**Time saved vs doing it manually:** 3-4 hours of research and writing → 45 minutes of guided collaboration

## What's good

- Best long-form writing quality of any LLM — doesn't sound robotic
- Handles 200K token context windows — feed it entire codebases
- Coding output is clean and well-structured
- Projects feature lets you build reusable knowledge bases
- Genuinely tries to be helpful rather than just agreeable

## What's not

- No image generation (use Midjourney or Stable Diffusion)
- No web browsing in the app (use Perplexity for research)
- Pro plan usage caps are opaque — you'll get throttled without warning
- API requires some technical knowledge to set up
- Cloud-only — no local option (lock-in concern)

## vs. the alternatives

| Feature | Claude | ChatGPT | Gemini |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| Writing quality | Best | Good | Good |
| Coding | Excellent | Excellent | Good |
| Free tier | Limited | Generous | Generous |
| Context window | 200K | 128K | 1M+ |
| Web browsing | No | Yes | Yes |
| Image gen | No | Yes (DALL-E) | Yes (Imagen) |
| Price (Pro) | $20/mo | $20/mo | $20/mo |

**Bottom line:** Claude for writing and coding quality. ChatGPT for the all-in-one Swiss army knife. Gemini for massive context and Google integration.

## FAQ

**Q: Claude or ChatGPT — which should I pick?**
A: If you write a lot of content or code, Claude. If you need image gen, web browsing, and plugins all in one place, ChatGPT. Most serious builders end up subscribing to both.

**Q: Is the API worth it over Pro?**
A: If you're building automations or hitting Pro rate limits, yes. For casual use, Pro is simpler.

**Q: Can Claude replace a copywriter?**
A: For first drafts and iteration, absolutely. For final brand voice and strategic direction, you still need a human eye — preferably yours.
