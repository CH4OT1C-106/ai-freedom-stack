## What is GitHub Copilot?

An AI code completion tool by GitHub/Microsoft. It integrates into VS Code, JetBrains, and other editors to suggest code as you type — from single lines to entire functions. Copilot Chat adds conversational AI for explanations and debugging.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Developers who want faster coding without switching editors
- **Not for:** Non-coders (it assists, it doesn't build for you) or people already using Cursor
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | Limited completions, limited chat |
| Individual | $10/mo | Unlimited completions + chat |
| Business | $19/mo | Team management, policy controls |

**Hidden costs:** None really. Pricing is straightforward.

**Free tier reality check:** Usable for light coding. You'll feel the limits on a real project.

## How we'd actually use it

Speed-coding a new feature:

1. Write a comment: `// function to validate email and check against blocklist`
2. Copilot generates the full function
3. Tab to accept, tweak as needed
4. Write the next comment, repeat
5. Use Copilot Chat to explain unfamiliar code in a dependency

**Time saved:** Boilerplate that took 30 minutes → 5 minutes

## What's good

- Autocomplete is fast and context-aware
- Works in your existing editor (no switching)
- Chat feature handles explanations well
- Free tier exists and is actually usable
- Understands most languages and frameworks

## What's not

- Doesn't understand your whole codebase like Cursor does
- Chat is good but not as capable as Claude for complex reasoning
- Suggestions can be wrong and confident about it
- Privacy: your code is sent to Microsoft's cloud
- Limited to code — Cursor handles full project management

## vs. the alternatives

| Feature | Copilot | Cursor | Windsurf |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| Editor | VS Code plugin | Standalone (VS Code fork) | Standalone |
| Codebase awareness | Limited | Full project | Full project |
| Chat quality | Good | Better | Good |
| Price | $10/mo | $20/mo | $15/mo |
| Free tier | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Bottom line:** Cursor is the better tool for solo builders. Copilot is fine if you don't want to switch editors.

## FAQ

**Q: Copilot or Cursor?**
A: Cursor. It does everything Copilot does plus full codebase chat, multi-file editing, and better AI integration. The only reason to pick Copilot is if you absolutely won't leave vanilla VS Code.

**Q: Is Copilot worth $10/mo?**
A: If you code daily, yes — it pays for itself in the first week. If you code occasionally, the free tier is enough.
