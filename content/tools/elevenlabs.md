## What is ElevenLabs?

ElevenLabs is a text-to-speech platform that generates voices nearly indistinguishable from real humans. Upload a script, pick a voice (or clone your own), and get broadcast-quality audio back in seconds.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** YouTube creators, podcasters, audiobook producers, anyone who needs voice content at scale
- **Not for:** Live conversation or real-time voice chat applications
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | 10k characters/month, 3 voices |
| Starter | $5/mo | 30k characters, 10 voices |
| Creator | $22/mo | 100k characters, voice cloning |
| Pro | $99/mo | 500k characters, 4hrs dubbing |

**Hidden costs:** Characters burn fast on long-form content. A 10-minute video script uses ~10-15k characters.

**Free tier reality check:** Enough for one short video per month. Not enough for regular content production.

## How we'd actually use it

1. Write your video script (or have AI generate it)
2. Pick a voice from the library that matches your brand
3. Paste the script, generate audio
4. Download and drop into your video editor

**Time saved vs doing it manually:** Recording + editing your own voice: 2-3 hours. ElevenLabs: 5 minutes.

## What's good

- Voice quality is genuinely the best available
- Huge voice library with diverse options
- API access for automation
- Voice cloning is eerily accurate

## What's not

- Credits disappear fast on long content
- Some voices have pacing issues (pauses too long)
- Workaround: post-process with ffmpeg to tighten silences
- Monthly credit reset — unused credits don't roll over

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use ElevenLabs voices commercially?**
A: Yes, all paid plans include commercial usage rights.

**Q: Is ElevenLabs worth it for a YouTube channel?**
A: If you're doing faceless content, absolutely. It replaces hiring a voiceover artist at a fraction of the cost.

**Q: What's the best alternative to ElevenLabs?**
A: PlayHT and Murf are the closest competitors. Neither quite matches the voice quality, but PlayHT has better pricing for high-volume use.
