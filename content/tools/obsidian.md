## What is Obsidian?

A note-taking and knowledge management app built on plain markdown files stored locally. No proprietary database, no cloud requirement, no account needed. Your notes are just `.md` files in a folder. The plugin ecosystem adds everything from AI chat to kanban boards to graph views of your knowledge.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Solo builders who want a knowledge base they own forever, with no cloud dependency
- **Not for:** Teams needing real-time collaboration (Notion is better for that)
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Personal | $0 | Full app, all core features |
| Commercial | $50/yr | Same app, commercial license |
| Sync | $4/mo | End-to-end encrypted cloud sync |
| Publish | $8/mo | Publish notes as a website |

**Hidden costs:** Sync between devices requires either paying for Obsidian Sync or setting up your own solution (iCloud, Syncthing, Git).

**Free tier reality check:** The free version IS the full product. Sync is the only thing that costs, and there are free alternatives.

## How we'd actually use it

Building your AI tools knowledge base:

1. Create a vault called "AI Freedom Stack"
2. One note per tool you research (plain markdown — same format as your Hugo site)
3. Link between tools: `[[Cursor]]` mentions `[[Claude]]` → knowledge graph builds itself
4. Use the AI plugin to chat with your notes: "Which tools have a free tier?"
5. When ready to publish, copy markdown to Hugo content directory — zero reformatting

**Time saved:** Your research becomes your content with no conversion step.

## What's good

- Files are yours — plain markdown in a folder. No lock-in. Period.
- Plugin ecosystem is massive (1000+ community plugins)
- Graph view shows connections between ideas visually
- Works completely offline
- Fast, even with thousands of notes
- AI plugins (Smart Connections, Copilot) add LLM capabilities locally

## What's not

- Mobile app is less polished than Notion's
- Sync between devices isn't built in for free
- No real-time collaboration
- Learning curve for the plugin system and linking syntax
- Looks plain out of the box (but highly customizable with themes)

## vs. the alternatives

| Feature | Obsidian | Notion | Logseq | Apple Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Data ownership | Local files | Cloud | Local files | iCloud |
| Free | Yes | Freemium | Yes | Yes |
| Offline | Full | Limited | Full | Full |
| Plugins | 1000+ | Limited | Growing | None |
| Collaboration | No | Yes | No | Limited |
| Lock-in risk | None | High | Low | Medium |

**Bottom line:** Obsidian for ownership and privacy. Notion for collaboration. If you're a solo builder, Obsidian wins.

## FAQ

**Q: Obsidian or Notion?**
A: Obsidian if you value owning your data and working offline. Notion if you need team collaboration and a prettier default UI. For solo builders building a personal knowledge base, Obsidian every time.

**Q: How do I sync between devices for free?**
A: iCloud (Mac/iOS), Google Drive, Syncthing (all platforms), or Git. All work. Obsidian Sync ($4/mo) is the easiest but not required.

**Q: Can Obsidian do AI stuff?**
A: Yes — plugins like Smart Connections and Obsidian Copilot add local LLM chat, semantic search, and AI writing assistance. It's not built-in but the ecosystem has it covered.
