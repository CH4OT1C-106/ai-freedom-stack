## What is Lovable?

An AI-powered web app generator. Describe what you want — "a habit tracker with streaks, dark theme, user auth" — and it generates a full working app with React frontend, Supabase backend, and polished UI. You can iterate with follow-up prompts and deploy instantly.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Solo builders validating ideas quickly, non-technical founders prototyping
- **Not for:** Production apps (the code quality isn't there yet) or developers who want full control
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | Limited generations |
| Starter | $20/mo | More generations, GitHub export |
| Pro | $50/mo | Priority, advanced features |

**Hidden costs:** Apps are hosted on Lovable by default. Moving to your own hosting requires exporting code (which needs cleanup).

**Free tier reality check:** Enough to build one prototype and see if the approach works for you.

## How we'd actually use it

Validating a SaaS idea in 30 minutes:

1. "Build a tool review directory with user ratings, search, filter by category, dark theme"
2. Lovable generates the full app
3. "Add user authentication and let reviewers submit their own reviews"
4. "Add Stripe for a $9/mo premium tier"
5. Share the prototype link to test demand before building it for real

**Time saved:** Weeks of development → 30 minutes. But remember — this is a prototype, not your final product.

## What's good

- Speed of idea-to-prototype is unmatched
- UI quality is genuinely impressive (better than Bolt.new)
- Supabase integration means real data persistence
- Can iterate conversationally
- Good for user testing and demand validation

## What's not

- Generated code needs significant cleanup for production
- Lock-in: default hosting is on Lovable's platform
- Complex app logic often breaks or needs manual fixes
- Not a replacement for actual development
- Supabase dependency baked in (can't easily switch backends)

## vs. the alternatives

| Feature | Lovable | Bolt.new | v0 |
|---------|---------|----------|-----|
| Focus | Full apps | Full apps | UI components |
| UI quality | Best | Good | Good |
| Backend | Supabase | Various | None |
| Code export | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Best for | Prototypes | Prototypes | Components |

**Bottom line:** Lovable for the prettiest prototypes. Bolt.new for more flexibility. v0 for just the frontend. All are prototyping tools, not production builders.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I launch a real product on Lovable?**
A: For an MVP with low traffic, yes. For a real business, export the code and rebuild the critical parts properly. Don't build your company on generated code.

**Q: Lovable or Bolt.new?**
A: Lovable produces better-looking apps. Bolt.new offers more backend flexibility. Try both free tiers with the same prompt and compare.
