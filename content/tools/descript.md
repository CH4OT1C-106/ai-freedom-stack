## What is Descript?

A video and audio editor where editing happens through a text transcript. Record or import media, Descript transcribes it, and you edit the text to edit the video. Delete words, rearrange paragraphs, remove filler words — the video follows. Also includes screen recording, AI eye contact correction, and studio-quality audio enhancement.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Podcasters, talking-head YouTubers, anyone who repurposes video into written content
- **Not for:** Cinematic video editors, B-roll heavy content, music production
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | 1 hr transcription, basic features, watermark |
| Hobbyist | $24/mo | 10 hrs transcription, no watermark |
| Business | $33/mo | 30 hrs, all AI features |

**Hidden costs:** Transcription hours are the real currency. Heavy creators will burn through Hobbyist fast.

**Free tier reality check:** Enough to try the concept. One hour goes quickly.

## How we'd actually use it

Turning a long video into multiple pieces of content:

1. Import your 30-minute recording
2. Descript transcribes it automatically
3. Delete all the "ums" and dead air with one click
4. Highlight the best 3-minute segment → export as a short
5. Copy the transcript → feed to Claude → blog post

**Time saved:** 2-3 hours of editing → 30 minutes of text editing

## What's good

- Text-based editing is genuinely revolutionary for talking-head content
- Filler word removal is magical
- AI eye contact correction actually works
- Transcription quality is excellent
- Repurposing workflow (video → text → social) is seamless

## What's not

- Useless for non-talking-head content
- Pricing is steep for casual users
- Desktop app can be resource-hungry
- Export quality occasionally inconsistent
- Not a replacement for a real video editor (Kdenlive, DaVinci, Premiere)

## FAQ

**Q: Descript or a traditional video editor?**
A: Both. Descript for talking-head/podcast editing. Traditional editor for everything else. They serve different workflows.

**Q: Can Descript replace my transcription service?**
A: Yes. Transcription quality rivals dedicated services. If you're paying for Otter or Rev just for transcription, Descript does that plus editing.
