## What is ChatGPT?

OpenAI's flagship consumer AI product. GPT-4o is the engine — a multimodal model that handles text, images, audio, and code. The app layers on web browsing, DALL-E image generation, file analysis, and a plugin ecosystem. It's the most feature-complete AI assistant available.

## Who is it for?

- **Best for:** Solo builders who want a single AI tool for everything — writing, research, coding, images
- **Not for:** People who need the absolute best quality in one domain (Claude beats it for writing, Midjourney for images)
- **Solo builder score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

## What does it cost?

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free | $0 | GPT-4o (limited), GPT-4o-mini, DALL-E, browsing |
| Plus | $20/mo | More GPT-4o, voice mode, early features |
| Pro | $200/mo | Unlimited GPT-4o, o1-pro for heavy reasoning |
| API | Pay-per-token | GPT-4o ~$2.50/M input |

**Hidden costs:** The $200/mo Pro tier exists and OpenAI keeps pushing features there first. Plus is fine for most people.

**Free tier reality check:** Surprisingly usable. You can get real work done without paying.

## How we'd actually use it

Building a landing page with all the trimmings:

1. Describe your product to ChatGPT, ask it to draft copy
2. Use DALL-E to generate a hero image
3. Ask it to write the HTML/CSS (or use with Cursor)
4. Have it browse competitor sites and suggest improvements
5. Generate social media posts to promote the launch

**Time saved vs doing it manually:** An entire day's work → 2-3 hours

## What's good

- Most versatile AI tool — text, code, images, browsing, files all in one
- Free tier is genuinely generous
- Plugin ecosystem adds real utility
- Voice mode is surprisingly natural
- Largest community — every problem has been solved by someone

## What's not

- Writing quality is good but not Claude-tier — tends toward generic phrasing
- DALL-E images are decent but can't touch Midjourney
- Gets chatty and over-explains things
- Memory feature is inconsistent
- OpenAI's business practices (data usage, pricing changes) are a trust concern

## vs. the alternatives

| Feature | ChatGPT | Claude | Gemini |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Versatility | Best | Limited | Good |
| Writing | Good | Best | Good |
| Image gen | DALL-E (decent) | None | Imagen (good) |
| Web browsing | Yes | No | Yes |
| Free tier | Generous | Limited | Generous |
| Context | 128K | 200K | 1M+ |

**Bottom line:** ChatGPT when you want one tool for everything. Claude when quality matters more than features.

## FAQ

**Q: ChatGPT Plus vs Pro — is $200/mo ever worth it?**
A: For most solo builders, no. Plus covers 95% of use cases. Pro is for heavy reasoning tasks (o1-pro) that most people don't need.

**Q: Should I use the app or the API?**
A: App for daily work. API when you're building automations or integrating into your own tools.

**Q: Is my data safe with OpenAI?**
A: They've improved, but read the fine print. Turn off "improve our models" in settings. For sensitive work, use the API with data retention off.
